Grafana is a powerful tool for real-time data analysis. The platform is highly customizable, allowing users to create dashboards with different types of graphs, tables, alerts and interactive panels. Grafana supports a wide variety of data sources, including relational databases, NoSQL, monitoring systems, and other cloud services. In addition, it has an active community and a large number of plugins and integrations available.

**The Grafana installation can be installed in three ways:**

- Installation from source code
- Installation from packages
- Docker Image

`Whichever installation method you choose, the process is generally well documented and can easily be found in the official Grafana documentation.`

## Installation of Grafana using Docker containers.


### Install [![Docker](https://img.shields.io/badge/Docker-2496ED?style=plastic&logo=docker&logoColor=white)]() Engine on Ubuntu

**OS requirementsðŸ”—**

+ **To install Docker Engine, you need the 64-bit version of one of these Ubuntu versions:**

    * Ubuntu Lunar 23.04
    * Ubuntu Kinetic 22.10
    * Ubuntu Jammy 22.04 (LTS)
    * Ubuntu Focal 20.04 (LTS)
    * Ubuntu Bionic 18.04 (LTS)
 
+ Docker Engine is compatible with `x86_64` (or `amd64`), `armhf`, `arm64`, and `s390x` architectures.

#### Uninstall old versions

Older versions of Docker went by the names of `docker`, `docker.io`, or `docker-engine`, you might also have installations of `containerd` or `runc.` Uninstall any such older versions before attempting to install a new version:

    sudo apt-get remove docker docker-engine docker.io containerd runc

> `apt-get` might report that you have none of these packages installed.

Images, containers, volumes, and networks stored in `/var/lib/docker/` arenâ€™t automatically removed when you uninstall Docker. If you want to start with a clean installation, and prefer to clean up any existing data, read the uninstall Docker Engine section.

### Install using shell script

If you wish, there is the option to run the automatic Docker installation script `install-docker.sh`. After accessing the **zabbix/zabbix-server-docker** repository, type the following command:

      ./install-docker.sh

Now just wait for the installation to finish!
